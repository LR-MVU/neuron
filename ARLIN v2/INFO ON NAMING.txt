please name your files as follows:


{date}_{Treatment1}_{Treatment2}_{PictureNumber}_XY{FOV}_{channel}.tif


ARLIN assumes the date is the same for all images in your experiment so it does not read in the date


The resulting excel files will have sheets sorted as "Treatment1_Treatment2"

ARLIN interprets the FOV to be equal to {PictureNumber}-{FOV}. Keep this in mind if you see any error messages, but otherwise it shouldn't affect you.
